# AI_Ethics

## Overview

This project explores the ethical challenges and considerations in Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a focus on algorithmic bias, transparency, explainability, and fairness. It combines theoretical analysis, real-world case studies, and practical audits of AI datasets to highlight the importance of responsible AI development and deployment.

## Contents

- **Theoretical Understanding:**
  - Definitions of key ethical concepts in AI (e.g., algorithmic bias, transparency, explainability).
  - Discussion of regulatory impacts (e.g., GDPR) on AI systems.

- **Case Study Analysis:**
  - Examination of real-world cases such as Amazonâ€™s biased hiring tool and facial recognition in policing.
  - Recommendations for mitigating bias and ensuring fairness.

- **Dataset Audit:**
  - Ethical audit of the COMPAS recidivism dataset using the AIF360 toolkit.
  - Calculation of fairness metrics and application of bias mitigation techniques.

- **Ethical Reflection:**
  - Application of ethical AI principles in a healthtech context (BathoPele project).

- **Policy Guideline:**
  - 1-page policy guideline for ethical AI in healthcare, covering consent, bias mitigation, and transparency.

## How to Use

1. **Requirements:**
   - Python 3.x
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Required libraries: `aif360`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`
   - (Optional) Google Colab for easy execution

2. **Running the Notebooks:**
   - Open `AI_Ethics.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Follow the notebook sections for theoretical background, case studies, and practical dataset audits.
   - For the COMPAS dataset audit, you may need to upload the dataset file when prompted.

## Ethical Focus Areas

- **Fairness:** Ensuring AI systems do not propagate or amplify bias.
- **Transparency:** Making AI systems and their decisions understandable and auditable.
- **Explainability:** Providing clear explanations for AI decisions, especially in high-stakes domains.
- **Privacy:** Respecting user data and complying with regulations like GDPR.

        "Our analysis focused on comparing outcomes between African-American (unprivileged) and Caucasian (privileged) individuals. We calculated metrics such as Statistical Parity Difference, Equal Opportunity Difference, and Disparate Impact Ratio.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Findings:\n",
        "- **Statistical Parity Difference** was negative, indicating a disadvantage for African-American defendants in receiving favorable outcomes.\n",
        "- **False Positive Rate (FPR)** was significantly higher for African-American individuals. This means more Black defendants were wrongly predicted as high-risk, potentially leading to unfair sentencing or denial of bail.\n",
        "- **Disparate Impact** fell below the recommended threshold of 0.8, confirming inequality in how the model treats different racial groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "To mitigate these biases, we propose:\n",
        "1. **Reweighing the dataset** using fairness preprocessing techniques to balance outcomes.\n",
        "2. **Post-processing adjustments** like equalized odds methods to ensure similar error rates across groups.\n",
        "3. **Human-in-the-loop reviews** for decisions affecting liberty, ensuring AI doesn’t operate unchecked.\n",
        "\n",
        "This audit highlights the importance of regular bias assessments for AI systems used in justice. Without intervention, such systems may reinforce systemic discrimination. We recommend that public institutions adopt fairness toolkits and explainability features before relying on AI-driven decisions."
